REQUIREMENTS: Java 8, Maven, X3DNA, SQL (MySQL is configured in src/main/resources/application.yml file), gcc and g++ or similar C/C++ compiler (clang)

To install (via terminal/command prompt)

Make sure you have Maven and Java 8 installed.  Also, gcc is used to compile the simulation code.  You can change that in the mcsrc/Makefile though.  This software is compatible with both MacOS X and Linux, and could possibly be run in Windows with Cygwin, but it has not been tested.

Make sure that X3DNA is installed and that your X3DNA environment variable points to the main folder of the X3DNA installation.

Go into the mcsrc folder and type this:

make


Then, make sure that you have MySQL installed.  Create a database schema called simdb.  Edit the src/main/resources/application.yml file in this project to enter your Google app client ID and secret, also the username and password that has rights the edit the database.

Typical MySQL command to create relevant database:
CREATE SCHEMA simdb;

From the main folder where this install document is found, type this:

mvn spring-boot:run


That is it.  The Spring Framework will create the tables that store the data.  Point your web browser to http://localhost:8080 and you are ready to go.  You must log in via a gmail account, the server uses OAuth2 to validate the user.

Application settings are in the src/main/resources/application.yml.  You may have to change the values of the database resources for JPA (by default it uses MySQL with account root with no password, which is a default setting on Mac if mysql is installed with homebrew; on Ubuntu and other Linux versions you may have to change the settings in the application.yml or in mysql) and register your own Google API key, but it will work on the localhost on port 8080 with the one provided.



TO UPDATE THE SYSTEM:

If you update to a newer version, you should go into the mcsrc folder and type "make" again, and then relaunch the system with "mvn spring-boot:run" from the main folder.
